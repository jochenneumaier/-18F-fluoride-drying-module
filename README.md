# 18F-fluoride-drying-module
Automated drying module for [18F]fluoride

One of the key strategies for radiochemical research facilities is the automation of synthesis processes. Unnecessary manual operations increase the radiation exposure of personnel, while simultaneously threatening the reliability of syntheses. We have previously reported an affordable open-source system comprising 3D-printed continuous flow reactors, a custom syringe pump, and a pressure regulator that can be used to perform radiofluorinations. In this paper, we address additional essential processes which are needed for radiotracer development and synthesis, with the aim of making laboratory work safer and research more efficient. We have designed and evaluated a fully automated system for rapidly and effectively processing and drying aqueous [18F]fluoride that can be directly connected to the cyclotron. This process relies on triflyl fluoride gas generation and allows nucleophilic [18F]fluoride to be prepared safely in a hotcell within 10 minutes and an activity recovery of 91.7 Â± 1.6% (n=5). Owing to the need for convenient radiofluorinated prosthetic ligands, we have adapted our continuous flow system to produce [18F]fluoroethyl tosylate (FEOTs) and [18F]fluoroethyl triflate (FEOTf), prosthetic groups that are widely used for late-stage fluoroethylation of PET tracers. The processes as well as the radiolabeling of different groups are compared and comprehensively discussed. Having a method providing [18F]fluoroethyl tosylate (FEOTs) as well as [18F]fluoroethyl triflate (FEOTf) quickly and highly efficiently is beneficial for radiochemical research.
